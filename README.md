# Remastered-MA-Geo-Diss

Data:
Prior to importing the data columns containing text (country names and country codes) were removed as they appeared to be causing an error. Additionally rows relating to independent olympic athletes and refugee athletes were removed as they are not relevant to the geographical nature of the study.

The original project only used a few events from some specific sports - this will likely impact results depending on how accessable sports are (e.g. some sports cost more to get involved in, cost more to build infrastructure, might be valued highly/negatively by a countries culture or authorities). The goal of this re master is not only to repeat the original tests with the original data but also to go further. Exploring tests that were considered and had be be dropped due to undergradute project constraints, and analysing the whole results from the 2016 Olympics.
